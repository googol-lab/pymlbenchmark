    I had to write some benchmarks first for a
    PR in :epkg:`scikit-learn` then for projects
    related to :epkg:`onnx`. After many copy pasting,
    I decided to factorize some code even though it breaks
    the first rule I decided to follow: having
    standalone script to run benchmarks...
    Well... nobody is perfect.
